abstract = {Metabolic homeostasis is achieved by complex molecular and cellular networks that differ significantly among individuals and are difficult to model with genetically engineered lines of mice optimized to study single gene function. Here, we systematically acquired metabolic phenotypes by using the EUMODIC EMPReSS protocols across a large panel of isogenic but diverse strains of mice (BXD type) to study the genetic control of metabolism. We generated and analyzed 140 classical phenotypes and deposited these in an open-access web service for systems genetics (www.genenetwork.org). Heritability, influence of sex, and genetic modifiers of traits were examined singly and jointly by using quantitative-trait locus (QTL) and expression QTL-mapping methods. Traits and networks were linked to loci encompassing both known variants and novel candidate genes, including alkaline phosphatase (ALPL), here linked to hypophosphatasia. The assembled and curated phenotypes provide key resources and exemplars that can be used to dissect complex metabolic traits and disorders.},

abstract = {Recent improvements in quantitative proteomics approaches, including Sequential Window Acquisition of all Theoretical Mass Spectra (SWATH-MS), permit reproducible large-scale protein measurements across diverse cohorts. Together with genomics, transcriptomics, and other technologies, transomic data sets can be generated that permit detailed analyses across broad molecular interaction networks. Here, we examine mitochondrial links to liver metabolism through the genome, transcriptome, proteome, and metabolome of 386 individuals in the BXD mouse reference population. Several links were validated between genetic variants toward transcripts, proteins, metabolites, and phenotypes. Among these, sequence variants in Cox7a2l alter its protein's activity, which in turn leads to downstream differences in mitochondrial supercomplex formation. This data set demonstrates that the proteome can now be quantified comprehensively, serving as a key complement to transcriptomics, genomics, and metabolomics--a combination moving us forward in complex trait analysis.},

This protocol is intended to help investigators make more informed decisions about choices of resources given different types of questions.

abstract = {Identifying genetic and environmental factors that impact complex traits and common diseases is a high biomedical priority. Here, we developed, validated, and implemented a series of multi-layered systems approaches, including (expression-based) phenome-wide association, transcriptome-/proteome-wide association, and (reverse-) mediation analysis, in an open-access web server (systems-genetics.org) to expedite the systems dissection of gene function. We applied these approaches to multi-omics datasets from the BXD mouse genetic reference population, and identified and validated associations between genes and clinical and molecular phenotypes, including previously unreported links between Rpl26 and body weight, and Cpt1a and lipid metabolism. Furthermore, through mediation and reverse-mediation analysis we established regulatory relations between genes, such as the co-regulation of BCKDHA and BCKDHB protein levels, and identified targets of transcription factors E2F6, ZFP277, and ZKSCAN1. Our multifaceted toolkit enabled the identification of gene-gene and gene-phenotype links that are robust and that translate well across populations and species, and can be universally applied to any populations with multi-omics datasets.},

@article{Belknap1996,
abstract = {Effective mapping strategies for quantitative trains must allow for the detection of the more important quantitative trait loci (QTLs) while minimizing false positives. Type I (false-positive) and Type II (false-negative) error rates were estimated from a computer simulation of QTL mapping in the BXD recombinant inbred (RI) set compromising 26 strains of mice, and comparisons made with theoretical predictions. The results are generally applicable to other RI sets when corrections are made for differing strain numbers and marker densities. Regardless of the number or magnitude of simulated QTLs contributing to the trait variance, the p value necessary to provide adequate protection against both Type I (alpha=.0001) and Type II (beta=.2) errors, a QTL would have to account for more than half of the between-strain (genetic) variance if the BXD or similar set was used alone. In contrast, a two-step mapping strategy was also considered, where RI strains are used as a preliminary screen for QTLs to be specifically tested (confirmed) in an F2 (or other) population. In this case, QTLs accounting for approximately 16{\%} of the between-strain variance could be detected with an 80{\%} probability in the BXD set when alpha = 0.2. To balance the competing goals of minimizing Type I and II errors, an economical strategy is to adopt a more stringent alpha initially for the RI screen, since this requires only a limited genome search in the F2 of the RI-implicated regions (approximately 10{\%} of the F2 genome when p {\textless} .01 in the RIs). If confirmed QTLs do not account in the aggregate for a sufficient proportion of the genetic variance, then a more relaxed alpha value can be used in the RI screen to increase the statistical power. This flexibility in setting RI alpha values is appropriate only when adequate protection against Type I errors comes from the F2 (or other) confirmation test(s).},

@article{Belknap1998,
abstract = {Increasing the number of mice used to calculate recombinant inbred (RI) strain means increases the accuracy of determining the phenotype associated with each genotype (strain), which in turn enhances quantitative trait locus (QTL) detection and mapping. The purpose of this paper is to examine quantitatively the effect of within-strain sample size (n) on additive QTL mapping efficiency and to make comparisons with F2 and backcross (BC) populations where each genotype is represented by only a single mouse. When 25 RI strains are used, the estimated equivalent number of F2 mice yielding the same power to detect WTLs varies inversely as a function of the heritability of the trait in the RI population (hRI2). For example, testing 25 strains with n = 10 per strain is approximately equivalent to 160 F2 mice when hRI2 = 0.2, but only 55 when hRI2 = 0.6. While increasing n is always beneficial, the gain in power as n increases is greatest when hRI2 is low and is much diminished at high hRI2 values. Thus, hRI2 is high, there is little advantage of large n, even when n approaches infinity. A cost analysis suggested that RI populations are more cost-effective than conventional selectively genotyped F2 populations at hRI2 values likely to be seen in behavioral studies. However, with DNA pooling, this advantage is greatly reduced and may be reversed depending on the values of hRI2 and n.},

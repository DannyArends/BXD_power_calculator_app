Forty-five inbred strains, six F1 hybrids, 14 congenic resistant strains, and 23 recombinant strains were tested for cadmium-induced testicular damage. The cdm gene is not closely linked with several gene loci.},

abstract = {Metabolic homeostasis is achieved by complex molecular and cellular networks that differ significantly among individuals and are difficult to model with genetically engineered lines of mice optimized to study single gene function. Here, we systematically acquired metabolic phenotypes by using the EUMODIC EMPReSS protocols across a large panel of isogenic but diverse strains of mice (BXD type) to study the genetic control of metabolism. We generated and analyzed 140 classical phenotypes and deposited these in an open-access web service for systems genetics (www.genenetwork.org). Heritability, influence of sex, and genetic modifiers of traits were examined singly and jointly by using quantitative-trait locus (QTL) and expression QTL-mapping methods. Traits and networks were linked to loci encompassing both known variants and novel candidate genes, including alkaline phosphatase (ALPL), here linked to hypophosphatasia. The assembled and curated phenotypes provide key resources and exemplars that can be used to dissect complex metabolic traits and disorders.},

abstract = {Recent improvements in quantitative proteomics approaches, including Sequential Window Acquisition of all Theoretical Mass Spectra (SWATH-MS), permit reproducible large-scale protein measurements across diverse cohorts. Together with genomics, transcriptomics, and other technologies, transomic data sets can be generated that permit detailed analyses across broad molecular interaction networks. Here, we examine mitochondrial links to liver metabolism through the genome, transcriptome, proteome, and metabolome of 386 individuals in the BXD mouse reference population. Several links were validated between genetic variants toward transcripts, proteins, metabolites, and phenotypes. Among these, sequence variants in Cox7a2l alter its protein's activity, which in turn leads to downstream differences in mitochondrial supercomplex formation. This data set demonstrates that the proteome can now be quantified comprehensively, serving as a key complement to transcriptomics, genomics, and metabolomics--a combination moving us forward in complex trait analysis.},

abstract = {A key characteristic of systems genetics is its reliance on populations that vary to a greater or lesser degree in genetic complexityâ€”from highly admixed populations such as the Collaborative Cross and Diversity Outcross to relatively simple crosses such as sets of consomic strains and reduced complexity crosses. This protocol is intended to help investigators make more informed decisions about choices of resources given different types of questions. We consider factors such as costs, availability, and ease of breeding for common scenarios. In general, we recommend using complementary resources and minimizing depth of resampling of any given genome or strain.},

abstract = {Identifying genetic and environmental factors that impact complex traits and common diseases is a high biomedical priority. Here, we developed, validated, and implemented a series of multi-layered systems approaches, including (expression-based) phenome-wide association, transcriptome-/proteome-wide association, and (reverse-) mediation analysis, in an open-access web server (systems-genetics.org) to expedite the systems dissection of gene function. We applied these approaches to multi-omics datasets from the BXD mouse genetic reference population, and identified and validated associations between genes and clinical and molecular phenotypes, including previously unreported links between Rpl26 and body weight, and Cpt1a and lipid metabolism. Furthermore, through mediation and reverse-mediation analysis we established regulatory relations between genes, such as the co-regulation of BCKDHA and BCKDHB protein levels, and identified targets of transcription factors E2F6, ZFP277, and ZKSCAN1. Our multifaceted toolkit enabled the identification of gene-gene and gene-phenotype links that are robust and that translate well across populations and species, and can be universally applied to any populations with multi-omics datasets.},
